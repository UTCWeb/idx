# idx
## A single-file PHP index browser for files and directories
### What does it do?
The index.php is a self-contained script with file and directory icons, styles and HTML that will output a full directory and file listing for every file contained within a single directory and its children (subdirectories) on a PHP LAMP webserver.
### How to use it?
Copy the index.php file to a directory in a LAMP webserver. Make the file executable (mode 0644 in most cases). Visit the directory path in a web browser.
